# Magnetgraph

Because why should you be able to change what you have said?

## About

Magnetgraph is a simple (inspired by `telegra.ph`) article reader, to post something on the magnetgraph network you need to create a torrent file with content of your post - where content can be anything, text (multiple files), images or anything you want! Anything that fit in 256kb (subject to change).
To check example post see `posts/` directory in this folder.

There is a demo instance running at magnetgraph.mrcyjanek.net

## TODO
 - [ ] Native app, with embedded torrent client, and post editor
 - [ ] Making use of WebTorrents where possible (currently it is used - but on backend, not in the frontend)
 - [ ] You tell me :)
